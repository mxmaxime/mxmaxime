### Hi there, I'm Maxime ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer at Airbus working on software to help people to do their job more efficiently.
I'm working for the Quality department, my goal is to legerage the power of data to bring value. To do so, I have two hats:
- understand how people work and what they need.
- develop data driven software.
